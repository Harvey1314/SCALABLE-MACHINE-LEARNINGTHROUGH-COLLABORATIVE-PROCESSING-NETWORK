# Scalable Machine Learning through Collaborative Processing Network

## Introduction
The "Scalable Machine Learning through Collaborative Processing Network" project aims to address the challenge of efficiently executing machine learning tasks across distributed systems. By decentralizing machine learning operations, our approach enhances processing speed and scalability while optimizing the use of computational resources. This system leverages a network of multiple computational hosts, each tasked with specific roles and coordinated by a master node.

## Features
- **Distributed Processing:** Utilizes multiple computational hosts to perform tasks concurrently, ensuring high throughput.
- **Real-Time Data Exchange:** Supports dynamic data exchange between nodes, enabling real-time processing.
- **Automatic Load Balancing:** Implements automatic load balancing to optimize resource usage and prevent bottlenecks.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Provides easy-to-use interfaces that abstract the complexities of the underlying network communications and task distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `opencv2`
- Network access between all participating nodes
